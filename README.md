      <p>Our goal from the beginning was to create a website that would be helpful for incoming juniors. We know this is a big change of work load and setting, but we, as DP canidates, wanted you all to know it is possible to make it through IB.</p>

      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Erica: </h4>
            <p>1. Lovely teacher and is very understanding. Make sure you keep in contact with them though because it makes them have a better understanding of when you really need help or canâ€™t complete an assignment in time.</p>
            <p>2. Grades arenâ€™t everything in her class and she does her best to give lots of mini assignments to get you lots of easy grades.</p>
            <p>3. Doesnâ€™t allow phones in class, and you can only do work or read once done with class work.</p>
            <p>4. You will most likely be busy the entire class and won't have much free time. Writing and reading is very prominent in this class so donâ€™t be surprised.</p>
      <h4>Victoria: </h4>
            <p>1. Do NOT wait for the last minute to do Mrs. Sewardâ€™s assignments. Do an even amount of work each day leading up to its due date. You donâ€™t want to be up late on Sunday night starting an 800 word essay! </p>
            <p>2. Definitely go to the Writing Center for an extra 10 points on your assignment. The tutors will also give great tips on how to improve your writing. </p>
            <p>3. Pay attention to using correct syntax and sentence structure in your writing. </p>
      <h4>William: </h4>
            <p>1. Use the tool of the writing center. It is free extra points and it actually helps make your writing skills and individual essays sound better.</p>
            <p>2. Procrastination never hurt me. ðŸ˜‚</p>
            <p>3. Talk to Ms. Seward about any concerns you have whether about a subject matter, the book, grammar, or etc. She is incredibly nice and understanding except for late work.</p>

      <h5>Brought you by Erica, Victoria, & William, July 14, 2023</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Erica: </h4>
            <p>1. Very difficult course if you donâ€™t keep up with the workload. You need to make sure that you are completing the work on time and not getting.</p>
            <p>2. The teaching style seems very college lecture heavy and you will have long assignments that will take a long time to complete. DO NOT PROCRASTINATE IN THIS CLASS IT WILL KILL YOU IF YOU DO!!</p>
      <h4>Victoria: </h4>
            <p>1. Get straight to the point in OPCVLs.</p>
            <p>2. Mr. McCafferty will ask for analysis in all of your writing. Have more analysis on historical events than just simply describing what happened.</p>
            <p>3. Participate in discussions even if you arenâ€™t sure your answer to the question is right. Not trying at all will result in getting a 0.</p>
      <h4>William: </h4>
            <p>1. Always evaluate sources even if it seems credible do it for the extra points.</p>
            <p>2. The more you write the better it makes you feel.</p>
            <p>3. Take the study guides in chunks or you will cry.</p>

      <p></p>
      <h4>Erica: </h4>
            <p>1. Strict but if the majority of the class all agrees on some minor changes, she will take into account the feedback and see what she can do. </p>
            <p>2. Itâ€™s a hard class because of the workload but the subject itself isnâ€™t the hardest in my opinion. Make sure you turn in your work on time.</p>
            <p>3. Phones arenâ€™t allowed most of the time and if you think it's a good time to have your phone out ask her beforehand. </p>

      <h5>Brought you by Erica & William, July 7, 2023</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Erica: </h4>
            <p>1. Great teacher but everyone learns best in different ways so his style of teaching may not be for everyone.</p>
            <p>2. Teaching style is note taking from PowerPoints and reading the textbook (Kognity).</p>
            <p>3. Allows phones in class and doesn't say much unless you are getting distracted by them. Try to not use them while heâ€™s teaching since itâ€™s disrespectful anyway.</p>

      <h2>Biology SL</h2>
      <h5>Brought you by Lizbeth & Zayra, July 21, 2023</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Lizbeth: </h4>
            <p>1. Although the textbook chapters are long, they will help have a stronger foundation for the class. Taking notes from the beginning will help when reviewing at the end of the year.</p>
            <p>2. Bioninja was a lifesaver when wanting a quick overview of a lesson. Bioninja is also straightforward, but it doesn't contain all the small details that do matter. I also watched YouTube videos when the textbook wouldn't grasp my attention (Cheryl Hickman had great videos but they were over 20 minutes).</p>
            <p>3. It is A LOT of content and you won't be able to know everything. That is okay, being strong in some topics more than others will still benefit !!</p>
      <h4>Zayra: </h4>
            <p>1. Read over content before you learn it in class. It's very useful to have some background info on what you're learning so that way you're not completely lost during class.</p>
            <p>2. Study based on your learning style. It's very important for you to be aware of how you learn best. Try different things like repetition, color coding, or creating fun acronyms to help remember content.</p>
            <p>3. Make sure to keep an organized binder/notebook. It makes it easier to find information to review for tests (especially the IB test).</p>

      <h5>Brought you by Lizbeth & Victoria, July 21, 2023</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Lizbeth: </h4>
      <h4>Victoria: </h4>
            <p>1. WRITE DOWN CALCULATOR STEPS WHEN GIVEN.</p>
            <p>2. Mr. Batrez would rather see you work and get the answer wrong than have a right answer with no work at all. He needs to see what you did wrong so he can help you.</p>
            <p>3. Pre-cal will be helpful to you when you get to Math Y2 if you manage to remember what you learned in the class. I recommend having your Pre-cal notes with you as a refresher getting into Math Y2.</p>
            <p>4. Be prepared to be called up to finish a problem on the whiteboard - everybody will go through it.</p>

      <p></p>
      <h4>Erica: *HL* </h4>
            <p>1. Ms. Tonche is great and you will have an assignment every class in the morning. You will read in class outloud. Instructions are only in Spanish and you need to have a basic understanding of being able to talk, read, and write.</p>
      <h4>Victoria: *SL* </h4>
            <p>1. Using word reference will help you learn more than using google translate.</p>
            <p>2. There may be times when you have no idea what is being read. Never be afraid to ask Ms.Morales to help you understand. There is a great chance that others are just as lost as you are.</p>
            <p>3. Practice speaking Spanish not only in class assignments but also with Ms. Morales and even your friends that know Spanish. Practicing will help you improve your pronunciation and prepare you for the speaking assessment.</p>
