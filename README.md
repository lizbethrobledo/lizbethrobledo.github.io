      <p>Our goal from the beginning was to create a website that would be helpful for incoming juniors. We know this is a big change of work load and setting, but we, as DP canidates, wanted you all to know it is possible to make it through IB.</p>

      <h2>Language and Literature HL</h2>
      <h5>Brought you by Erica, Victoria, & William, June 23, 2023</h5>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Erica: </h4>
            <p>1. Lovely teacher and is very understanding. Make sure you keep in contact with them though because it makes them have a better understanding of when you really need help or canâ€™t complete an assignment in time.</p>
            <p>2. Grades arenâ€™t everything in her class and she does her best to give lots of mini assignments to get you lots of easy grades.</p>
            <p>3. Doesnâ€™t allow phones in class, and you can only do work or read once done with class work.</p>
            <p>4. You will most likely be busy the entire class and won't have much free time. Writing and reading is very prominent in this class so donâ€™t be surprised.</p>
      <h4>Victoria: </h4>
            <p>1. Do NOT wait for the last minute to do Mrs. Sewardâ€™s assignments. Do an even amount of work each day leading up to its due date. You donâ€™t want to be up late on Sunday night starting an 800 word essay! </p>
            <p>2. Definitely go to the Writing Center for an extra 10 points on your assignment. The tutors will also give great tips on how to improve your writing. </p>
            <p>3. Pay attention to using correct syntax and sentence structure in your writing. </p>
      <h4>William: </h4>
            <p>1. Use the tool of the writing center. It is free extra points and it actually helps make your writing skills and individual essays sound better.</p>
            <p>2. Procrastination never hurt me. ðŸ˜‚</p>
            <p>3. Talk to Ms. Seward about any concerns you have whether about a subject matter, the book, grammar, or etc. She is incredibly nice and understanding except for late work.</p>
        <h4>Lizbeth: </h4>
            <p>You will eventually get assigned reading (from 70 to 150 pages), and get Quote Quiz on Monday. READ. I usually read the weekend before the test since everything was fresh in my mind, but Ms.Seward recommends reading it twice for extra foundation.  </p>

      <h2>History of the Americas HL</h2>
      <h5>Brought you by Erica, Victoria, & William, July 14, 2023</h5>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Erica: </h4>
            <p>1. Very difficult course if you donâ€™t keep up with the workload. You need to make sure that you are completing the work on time and not getting.</p>
            <p>2. The teaching style seems very college lecture heavy and you will have long assignments that will take a long time to complete. DO NOT PROCRASTINATE IN THIS CLASS IT WILL KILL YOU IF YOU DO!!</p>
      <h4>Victoria: </h4>
            <p>1. Get straight to the point in OPCVLs.</p>
            <p>2. Mr. McCafferty will ask for analysis in all of your writing. Have more analysis on historical events than just simply describing what happened.</p>
            <p>3. Participate in discussions even if you arenâ€™t sure your answer to the question is right. Not trying at all will result in getting a 0.</p>
      <h4>William: </h4>
            <p>1. Always evaluate sources even if it seems credible do it for the extra points.</p>
            <p>2. The more you write the better it makes you feel.</p>
            <p>3. Take the study guides in chunks or you will cry.</p>

      <h2>Environmental Science and Societies SL</h2>
      <h5>Brought you by Erica, Victoria, & William, June 30, 2023</h5>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Erica: </h4>
            <p>1. Strict but if the majority of the class all agrees on some minor changes, she will take into account the feedback and see what she can do. </p>
            <p>2. Itâ€™s a hard class because of the workload but the subject itself isnâ€™t the hardest in my opinion. Make sure you turn in your work on time.</p>
            <p>3. Phones arenâ€™t allowed most of the time and if you think it's a good time to have your phone out ask her beforehand. </p>
      <h4>Victoria: </h4>
            <p>1. Use the time Mrs. Castillo gives to study for tests to actually study for the test; pick good study buddies!</p>
            <p>2. For your IA, you will make your life easier if you conduct your own experiment than making a survey.</p>
            <p>3. It's easier and quicker to find information in the physical ESS textbook than on Kognity, so use the physical textbook to fill out note sheets.</p>
      <h4>William: </h4>
            <p>1. Try to be objective about the work as a subjective view may lead to a wrong interpretation of the directions in the class.</p>
            <p>2. I think this goes for all classes but donâ€™t play on your phone. She especially dislikes it.</p>
            <p>3. Donâ€™t play with lab equipment, which is pretty self explanatory, but definitely strongly recommended.</p>

      <h2>Psychology SL</h2>
      <h5>Brought you by Erica & William, July 7, 2023</h5>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Erica: </h4>
            <p>1. Great teacher but everyone learns best in different ways so his style of teaching may not be for everyone.</p>
            <p>2. Teaching style is note taking from PowerPoints and reading the textbook (Kognity).</p>
            <p>3. Allows phones in class and doesn't say much unless you are getting distracted by them. Try to not use them while heâ€™s teaching since itâ€™s disrespectful anyway.</p>
      <h4>William: </h4>
            <p>1. Always do the readings and fill out the information regarding the studies because as long and weird worded as they sometimes may seem, they will be very important for the exam and SAQ tests.</p>
            <p>2. The worksheets may be long but they are very worth it when studying or when you need to find an SAQ study for another worksheet. Why do the work twice, donâ€™t do more work later.</p>
            <p>3. There are often helpful activities in this class so try to pay attention and use them as a tool to grasp concepts.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Biology SL</h2>
      <h5>Brought you by Lizbeth & Zayra, July 21, 2023</h5>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Lizbeth: </h4>
            <p>1. Although the textbook chapters are long, they will help have a stronger foundation for the class. Taking notes from the beginning will help when reviewing at the end of the year.</p>
            <p>2. Bioninja was a lifesaver when wanting a quick overview of a lesson. Bioninja is also straightforward, but it doesn't contain all the small details that do matter. I also watched YouTube videos when the textbook wouldn't grasp my attention (Cheryl Hickman had great videos but they were over 20 minutes).</p>
            <p>3. It is A LOT of content and you won't be able to know everything. That is okay, being strong in some topics more than others will still benefit !!</p>
      <h4>Zayra: </h4>
            <p>1. Read over content before you learn it in class. It's very useful to have some background info on what you're learning so that way you're not completely lost during class.</p>
            <p>2. Study based on your learning style. It's very important for you to be aware of how you learn best. Try different things like repetition, color coding, or creating fun acronyms to help remember content.</p>
            <p>3. Make sure to keep an organized binder/notebook. It makes it easier to find information to review for tests (especially the IB test).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>Math Y2 SL</h2>
      <h5>Brought you by Lizbeth & Victoria, July 21, 2023</h5>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Lizbeth: </h4>
            <p>1. If you have IB Math Y1 (Alg 2) with Mr. Morales, keep everything! Around March you will begin to review for the test, these notes will help when reviewing.</p>
            <p>2. Topics will go by very quickly, so if you don't understand or need help with any assignments, Mr. Batrez is always there in his room during lunch to help.</p>
            <p>3. Organize your notes !!! Mr. Batrez lets you use your notes when taking a quiz, but if you don't take notes or if you don't know where anything is at, your notes are useless. (Put your phone down and take good notes!)</p>
      <h4>Victoria: </h4>
            <p>1. WRITE DOWN CALCULATOR STEPS WHEN GIVEN.</p>
            <p>2. Mr. Batrez would rather see you work and get the answer wrong than have a right answer with no work at all. He needs to see what you did wrong so he can help you.</p>
            <p>3. Pre-cal will be helpful to you when you get to Math Y2 if you manage to remember what you learned in the class. I recommend having your Pre-cal notes with you as a refresher getting into Math Y2.</p>
            <p>4. Be prepared to be called up to finish a problem on the whiteboard - everybody will go through it.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Theory of Knowledge & AP Gov</h2>
      <h5>Brought you by Everyone, July 21, 2023</h5>
      <p></p>
      <p>Both classes will be there to support you in your IB journey and understand you have other stressful classes. For TOK, you need to be active in the class to take notes since they will help for quizzes. For AP Govt., there is a lot of material to cover (read the textbook), but don't stress if everything doesn't stick. For both classes, if you do everything that is asked, you will pass!</p>
      <p>Appreciate your outside breaks from TOK because you will miss them later.</p>

      <h2>Spanish HL & SL</h2>
      <h5>Brought you by Erica, Victoria, & William, July 28, 2023</h5>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Erica: *HL* </h4>
            <p>1. Ms. Tonche is great and you will have an assignment every class in the morning. You will read in class outloud. Instructions are only in Spanish and you need to have a basic understanding of being able to talk, read, and write.</p>
      <h4>Victoria: *SL* </h4>
            <p>1. Using word reference will help you learn more than using google translate.</p>
            <p>2. There may be times when you have no idea what is being read. Never be afraid to ask Ms.Morales to help you understand. There is a great chance that others are just as lost as you are.</p>
            <p>3. Practice speaking Spanish not only in class assignments but also with Ms. Morales and even your friends that know Spanish. Practicing will help you improve your pronunciation and prepare you for the speaking assessment.</p>
      <h4>William: *HL* </h4>
            <p>1. As a non fluent Spanish speaker, finding someone to help you with this class is a great help.Obviously not cheating but they can help you get more proficient with the language.</p>
            <p>2. Try to pay attention and pick up as many words as you can to gain proficiency faster.</p>

      <h2>German HL & SL</h2>
      <h5>Brought you by our *Special Guests* Camila & Karen, August 4, 2023</h5>
      <p></p>      
      <h4>Camila: *HL* </h4>
            <p>1. Make a German diary where you write an entry  everyday to practice writing German. Write about anything like what your day was like, how you felt or even write a story, whatever you want to do.</p>
            <p>2. Practice conversations in German by talking with other german students to improve your speaking and pronunciation. Give each other feedback.</p>
            <p>3. Watch German films or shows to practice listening to german. Watch the films at least twice to fully understand conversations, plot, common words, sentence structure, etc.</p>
      <h4>Karen: *SL* </h4>
            <p>1. Watch shows or movies in German (you can have English subtitles and German audio or German subtitles and English audio) or (if you really like the show, watch it in English to understand it and then in German). Listen to music in German.</p>
            <p>2. Class will also be easier cause Here Johnson will only be talking to you in German more often, almost exclusively.</p>
            <p>3. Practice speaking and writing German inside and outside of class
(I wish I would have done these sooner). All of these will help with expanding your vocabulary and being able to formulate sentences better.</p>
